Homework for Sogang University Embedded System Software (CSE4116) Course, 2017 Spring

## Description
### HW1: Calculator on board with IPC
* Implemented clock, counter, text editor, and draw board by making cooperating processes communicate via IPC.
* output process uses device control methods.

### HW2: Device drivers
* Implemented device drivers that control FPGA character devices via system calls. 

### HW3: Hardware interrupt handlers and kernel timer
* Implemented interrupt handlers that are registered to IRQ table and operated when a specific hardware device input is given.
* Also implemented kernel timers.

### Final Project: Android applications and native libraries
* Implemented Android application that calls device driver codes in kernel via system calls by using JNI.
* Also implemented local services and threads to perform some designated tasks.
